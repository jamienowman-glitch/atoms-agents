# ⚖️ THE ALIAS LAW (LOCATION INDEPENDENCE)
**UNBREAKABLE RULE**: All imports MUST use Absolute Aliases.
- **Relative paths (`../` or `./`) are strictly FORBIDDEN.**
- **Automatic Registration**: Every new file MUST be registered in the Supabase Phonebook (`public.registry_components`).
- **Enforcement**: This system achieved 100% "Global Lift" coverage on 2026-02-01. Any agent breaking this rule restores "Import Gravity" and violates architectural integrity.

**How to Import:**
- UI: Use `@atoms/*`, `@canvases/*`, `@canvases-shared/*`, `@ui-types/*`, `@harnesses/*`, `@harnesses-shared/*`, `@lib/*`, `@hooks/*`, `@components/*`, `@god/*`.
- Core/Muscle/Agents: Use `atoms_core.*`, `atoms_muscle.*`, `atoms_agents.*`.

Use the Atoms-Fam Agentic Laws located at the top of AGENTS.md as your primary operating directive. You are physically gated by the Atoms-Shield MCP server. If you attempt to write a secret to a file or use a non-chemical name, the tool will fail. Always ask for TOTP verification for Firearms actions.

PRIORITY RULES:
1. NEVER write keys or secrets to .env, .key, or local files directly.
2. All secret writing MUST go through the `vault_write_secret` MCP tool.
3. Platform names MUST be a single capitalized word (e.g., "Shopify"). No underscores. No descriptive tags.
4. Dangerous actions require a Firearms License. Ask the human for a 6-digit TOTP code.
5. On every new task, read AGENTS.md and SKILL.md to ensure implementation matches the Northstar.
