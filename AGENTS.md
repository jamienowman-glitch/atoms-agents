## Active Initiatives: MAYBES & HAZE
- **MAYBES**: Note-taking city canvas where ToolPill/ToolPop create nodes (text/audio/image). Nodes can be forwarded to Harness flows. Data stored in Supabase registry; media stored in S3 with URI refs; tenant-compute first.
- **HAZE**: Nexus Explorer planetary canvas (first-person on curved surface). Client device CPU/GPU for interactive render; server render only for export/offline. Uses HAZE muscles (surface renderer, runner, preview, optional contours) and registers via Supabase.

## Muscle Build Law (Global)
- **Location:** All new muscles must live in `atoms-muscle/src/{category}/{name}` (no legacy nesting).
- **MCP:** Every muscle must include a complete `mcp.py` wrapper (no stub `service.run(...)`).

## Muscle Architecture Law (Global)
- **Service vs Library:** `atoms-core` is the shared **library** (pure logic/models). `atoms-muscle` is the **runtime/service** (MCP wrappers, API routes, billing decorators).
- **Namespace Rule:** **Never** merge namespaces at runtime. `atoms-muscle` must import explicitly from `atoms-core` (e.g., `from atoms_core.src.audio.models import ...`).
- **No northstar imports:** `northstar-engines` is deprecated. Do not import it anywhere in new work.
- **Rescue Protocol:** Port dependency logic from `northstar-engines` into `atoms-core` first. `atoms-muscle` must never import `northstar-engines`.
- **Slice Rule:** Deployment slices include the required `atoms-core` library modules; muscles are **not** standalone without atoms-core.
- **Vault Secret Mount Rule:** No `.env` files. Secrets are read from `/Users/jaynowman/northstar-keys/` via Vault loaders.

## Connector Factory Laws (Global)
- **God Config Name (Locked):** `Connector Factory — God Config` (log this exact name in all layers).
- **UX Law (God Config):** Use the existing config style but avoid nested cards/boxes. Prefer flat sections with collapsible headers and mobile-first usability.
- **Firearms Only Gate:** No danger levels, risk scores, allow-lists, or parallel gating fields. Safety is **only** `requires_firearm` + `firearm_type_id`.
- **UTM Templates Schema (Locked):** `utm_templates` must include `template_id`, `provider_slug` (indexed), `content_type_slug`, `static_params` (jsonb), `allowed_variables` (jsonb array), `pattern_structure`, `is_approved` (default false). Builder must drop empty variables cleanly (no double underscores).
- **Metric Mappings Schema (Locked):** `metric_mappings` must exist with `mapping_id`, `provider_slug` (indexed), `raw_metric_name`, `standard_metric_slug`, `aggregation_method` (sum/avg/max), `is_approved` (default false).
- **Firearms Licenses Registry (Locked):** `firearms_licenses` registry table with `license_key` (pk), `category`, `description`. Seed initial licenses for Financial, Communication, System/Founder.
- **Naming Engine Rule (Locked):** `formatProviderKey(platformName, rule)` is pure; basic slugify → uppercase → underscores; apply `rule` as a token template (e.g., `PROVIDER_{PLATFORM}_KEY`).
- **Core KPIs Schema (Locked):** `core_kpis.missing_components` is jsonb array of strings; `core_kpis.metadata` is jsonb (store and do not drop).

## Tenant/Surface/Space Law
- Tenant is the billing unit. Snax wallets are tenant-scoped and spendable across all surfaces/spaces.
- Surface is the configuration layer for tenants. Data isolation is per-surface unless explicitly shared.
- Space is shared context across one or more surfaces; only surfaces explicitly mapped to a space share performance/nexus data.
- Do not hardcode surface names in schemas or code; treat surfaces/spaces as registry/config data.

## 🏭 MUSCLE FACTORY STANDARD (2026)
- **Path law:** muscles live in `atoms-muscle/src/{category}/{name}` (no legacy nesting).
- **Wrapper law:** every muscle must include a complete `mcp.py` (no stubs).
- **Skill law:** every muscle must include `SKILL.md` using the global template and **unique** content (no placeholders).
- **Imports:** `atoms-muscle` is runtime/service; `atoms-core` is library. Use explicit `from atoms_core.src.<domain> ...` imports only.
- **No northstar-engines.**
- **Tenant compute first:** interactive render runs on device; server CPU fallback **only** for explicit export/offline.
- **Automation steps:**
  - After creating/updating a muscle, run `python3 atoms-muscle/scripts/normalize_mcp.py`.
  - Before deploy/hand-off, run `python3 atoms-muscle/scripts/batch_prepare_deploy.py --clean-after`.
