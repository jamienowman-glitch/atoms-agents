# AGENTS.md — AgentFlow (The Canvas Core)

> **The Northstar**: "We are creating Shopify, Klaviyo, Photoshop, CapCut... all run by Agents and Humans on collaborative Canvases."

## 🛑 THE ATOMIC MANDATE
1.  **Collaborative Core**: The "Canvas" is the shared workspace for Humans and Agents.
2.  **Never Monolith**: Every concern must be its own "Atom" (Table, Component, Service, Site).
3.  **UI Foundry**: We build UI tools here that extend the Console.

## 🏗️ CONTEXT
This repository holds the **Canvas Components**:
-   **Nodes**: The boxes on the graph.
-   **Edges**: The connections.
-   **Lenses**: The different views (Flow, Safety, Tech).
