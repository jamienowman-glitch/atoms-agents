# AGENTS.md — AgentFlow (SHUTTING DOWN)

> **🛑 SHUTDOWN NOTICE**: This repository is being dismantled. We are lifting working components into `atoms-*` repositories. DO NOT BUILD NEW FEATURES HERE.

> **The Northstar**: "We are creating Shopify, Klaviyo, Photoshop, CapCut... all run by Agents and Humans on collaborative Canvases."

## 🎨 UI FOUNDRY (V2 STANDARD)
> **The Law**: All new Canvases must use the **V2 Contract** and **Vario Harness**.
> **The 3 Surfaces**:
> 1.  **ChatRail (Left)**: Communication & Stream.
> 2.  **TopPill (Top-Right)**: Global View/Export.
> 3.  **ToolPop (Bottom)**: Contextual "Dynamic Island" with Dual Magnifiers & Sliders.
> **Reference**: `atoms-ui/.agent/skills/canvas-forge/SKILL.md`

## 🛑 THE ATOMIC MANDATE
1.  **Collaborative Core**: The "Canvas" is the shared workspace for Humans and Agents.
2.  **Never Monolith**: Every concern must be its own "Atom" (Table, Component, Service, Site).
3.  **UI Foundry**: We build UI tools here that extend the Console.

## 🏗️ CONTEXT
This repository holds the **Canvas Components**:
-   **Nodes**: The boxes on the graph.
-   **Edges**: The connections.
-   **Lenses**: The different views (Flow, Safety, Tech).
