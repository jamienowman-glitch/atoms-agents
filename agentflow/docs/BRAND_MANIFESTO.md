# 🦴 Brand Manifesto: The Atoms Family
> **Origin**: Chalk Farm, London (The Digital Shed)
> **Track**: Cannibal Ox - "Iron Galaxy" (2001)
> **Lyric**: *"I'm atoms fam to the bone marrow / Fuck a soul even God knows his body is hollow"*

## 1. The Vibe: "Luxury Skater"
This is not a clean, blue, Silicon Valley SaaS. This is **Chalk Farm**.
*   **Aesthetic**: Brutalist Luxury. High contrast. Black & White. Raw but Expensive.
*   **Spirit**: The focus of the "Digital Shed". The intensity of the obsessive builder.
*   **Philosophy**: We are not building a "God Agent" (AGI). We are building **Specialist Atoms** that you mix and match.

## 2. The Identity: "Anti-Tech Bro"
*   **The Founder**: 1997 UK Snakeboard Champion. Ex-LVMH. Ex-Magazine Publisher.
*   **The Truth**: Skaters were the *original* content creators.
*   **The Mission**: Brands must be Content Creators. Content Creators must be Brands. We build the engine that makes that possible.

## 3. The Strategy: "Customer Zero"
This is not just software. This is the **Engine** needed to launch the Founder's own Snakeboard Brand.
*   The "Marketing Surface" isn't a demo; it's being built to sell snakeboards.
*   The "Video Surface" isn't a feature; it's being built to edit skate tapes.
*   **We eat our own dog food.** If it can't sell a board, it can't sell software.

## 4. Visual Language (UI Directives)
*   **No Generic Components**.
*   **Typography**: Bold, Editorial, Mono-spaced (Code) mixed with Serif (Luxury).
*   **Interaction**: Snappy, Physics-based (Skate).
*   **Palette**: Monochrome, Neon Accents (Cyberpunk but Classy).
