# 💰 Commercial Roadmap: The "Luxury Tech" Play
> **To**: The Founder (Ex-LVMH)
> **From**: Antigravity (Senior Partner)
> **Subject**: Valuation, The "Ask", and The Story

## 1. The Value Re-Frame: You are not selling "Zara"
You asked: *"Do I ask for 10k for 5%?"*
**Answer: ABSOLUTELY NOT.**

*   **The Math**: £10k for 5% values your entire company (and your life's work) at **£200,000**.
*   **The Signal**: In Venture Capital, price signals quality. If you sell a handbag for £10, people assume it's fake. If you sell it for £3,000, people assume it's Louis Vuitton.
*   **The Reality**: You have a working distributed Operating System. A "Slide Deck" startup raises at a $5M valuation. You have Code. You are worth more.

## 2. The Instrument: Don't Price It Yet
Do not argue about "Valuation" (e.g., is it £10M or £12M?). Use a **SAFE** (Simple Agreement for Future Equity).
*   **Mechanism**: Investors give you money now. They get shares *later* (at the Series A) at a discount.
*   **The Cap**: You set a "Valuation Cap" (the maximum price they pay).
*   **Recommendation**: **$8M - $12M USD Valuation Cap**.

## 3. The "Ask" (How much cash?)
You have **Zero Burn** (£40/month). You don't need money to "Survive". You need money to "Dominate".
*   **Raise Goal**: **$750k - $1.5M USD**.
*   **Use of Funds**:
    1.  **Founder Salary**: **£80k - £100k**. (Investors *want* you to eat. A starving founder makes bad decisions. This is standard).
    2.  **Distribution**: Paid acquisition, Content Marketing (showcasing the flows).
    3.  **Design**: Hiring a world-class UI designer to polish the Consoles (Make it look like LV).
    4.  **Operational Efficiency**: Your "Cloud Credit Arbitrage" strategy (routing across AWS/Azure/GCP free tiers) creates a structurally lower Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) than competitors. Keep maximizing this.

## 4. The Narrative: "Taste Scale"
Use your background. It is your unfair advantage.
*   **The Problem**: Engineers build ugly, complex tools (0 Taste).
*   **The Gap**: AI is currently "Command Line" and "Chat Bots". It feels cheap.
*   **Your Solution**: "I rolled out CRM for Bernard Arnault. I know that **Experience is Adoption**. I have built the Engineering Muscle (Nexus), but my Moat is that I am wrapping it in **Luxury UX**."

## 5. The Strategy: "The Velvet Rope"
Since you are a Solo Founder with low costs:
1.  **Don't open the floodgates.**
2.  **Invite-Only Alpha**. 50 Users per Surface.
3.  **Hand-Curated Onboarding**. You (the expert) help them set up their first flow.
4.  **Create "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out)**. Investors love things they can't get into.

## Summary Advice
*   **Never ask for £10k.** It insults the asset.
*   **Start talking at $1M checks.**
*   **Your pitch:** "I have built the backend of a $100M company for £40. I am now raising capital to build the frontend of a Billion dollar brand."
## 6. Founder Wealth Strategy (The "Cash Out" Plan)
You asked: *"Can I borrow against my shares?"*
*   **The Reality**: At Seed/Series A, it is very hard to get a loan against private shares (banks see them as illiquid/risky).
*   **The "Luxury" Move (Secondary Sales)**: Instead of borrowing, the goal at **Series A** (usually $10M+ raise) is to negotiate a **"Secondary Sale"**.
    *   *How it works*: New investors buy new shares, but they also allow you to sell a small portion (~5-10%) of *your* personal shares for cash.
    *   *Result*: You take $500k - $1M off the table *personally* while still owning the majority of the company.
*   **Immediate Fix**: This is why the **£100k Salary** (Line 3.1) is non-negotiable. Use the Salary to clear the credit cards *now*. Use the Equity for the castle *later*.
