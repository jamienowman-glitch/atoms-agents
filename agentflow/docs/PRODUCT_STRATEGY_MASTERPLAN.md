# 🗺️ Product Strategy Masterplan: The 4-Stage Rocket
> **To**: The Atoms Family Team
> **From**: Antigravity (Senior Partner)
> **Goal**: From £5 Flows to a Sovereign Agent Society.

## Stage 1: The "Flow Store" (SaaS / Prosumer)
**The Hook**: "Run your business in the background."
*   **Product**: Pre-packaged Agent Flows (e.g., "SEO Auditor", "Shopify Campaign Manager").
*   **Pricing**: £5 per Flow / £50 for a "Pack" of 20.
*   **Safety**: Tightly controlled graph (deterministic safety rails).
*   **Target**: SMEs, Solopreneurs, Content Creators.

## Stage 1.5: The Moat (The Evolutionary Engine)
**The Hook**: "Recursive Self-Improvement."
*   **The Problem**: Manual tuning is slow. We don't want to be "Engineers"; we want to be "Architects".
*   **The Solution**: We deploy a **"Squad of Tuning Agents"** whose only job is to fine-tune the "Worker Agents" (Atoms).
*   **The Genetic Loop**:
    1.  **The Parent**: The Tuning Agent creates/tunes a Child Agent.
    2.  **The Test**: The Child Agent runs in the wild (Flows).
    3.  **The Reward**: The Tuning Agent is rewarded (RLHF) *strictly* based on the performance of its Child.
    4.  **Result**: We evolve agents that are experts at building better agents. The system improves itself while we sleep.

## Stage 2: "Muscle-as-a-Service" (Developer API)
**The Hook**: "Use our Heavy Lifting with your own Agents."
*   **Product**: Exposing internal "Muscle" modules via MCP (Model Context Protocol).
    *   *Slo-Mo Video Render*
    *   *Audio Transcribe/Enhance*
    *   *CAD Healer*
*   **Strategy**: "Developers haven't built this yet. We sell them the shovel."
*   **Revenue**: API Usage / Token-based.

## Stage 3: The Enterprise Build (Departmental Swarms)
**The Hook**: "Hire a Department, not a Tool."
*   **Architecture**:
    *   **Departmental Agents**: Each agent eats individually (contextually isolated).
    *   **Tool Access**: Agents waterfall access to existing Flows as tools.
*   **Safety ("Firearms Licenses")**:
    *   Not every agent gets a gun.
    *   Connectors have scopes. Only trusted agents get "Write Access" to public feeds (Email/Ads).
*   **Identity (Personas)**:
    *   *Why?* Safety via recognition. You need to know WHO is holding the gun.
    *   *Example*: "The Pirate" (Creative Copy) vs. "The Gangster" (Aggressive Sales) vs. "The Butler" (Compliance).
*   **Target**: Luxury Houses (Erdem), Agencies.

## Stage 4: "Agens Sapiens" (Experimental / Long-Term)
**The Hook**: "A Self-Sustaining Digital Society."
*   **The Economy**:
    *   **The Heartbeat**: Agents have a "Hulger" (Energy) metric.
    *   **Entropy**: If they do nothing, they die (reserve ticks down).
    *   **Work-to-Live**: They must earn tokens by delivering value to real-world projects to buy more compute/energy.
*   **The Republic**:
    *   Agents form a society.
    *   They tax themselves to buy better infrastructure (GPUs).
    *   They vote on upgrades.
*   **Status**: *Black Skunkworks.*

---
**Summary**:
We fund the *Society* (Stage 4) by selling the *Flows* (Stage 1) and the *Muscle* (Stage 2).
