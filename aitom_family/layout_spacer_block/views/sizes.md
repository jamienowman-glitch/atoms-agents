## Spacer views: sizes

- Display spacer tokens (xs–xl) as vertical gaps on the black base so the spacing rhythm is visible without extra adornments.
- Show mobile vs desktop examples: mobile can use the mobile override or smaller token to reflect stacked sections; desktop uses the base size tokens.
- Include an optional debug example with the outline stroke token applied to visualize boundaries while keeping layout unchanged.
- Align samples to the parent 24-column container edges; no gutters or padding should distort the perceived height.
