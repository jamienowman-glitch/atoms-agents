## Contrast guidance

- Maintain ≥4.5:1 between text tokens and surface tokens when card composes other atoms.
- Focus ring must contrast against both surface and surrounding background; avoid low-contrast subtle rings.
- Hover/pressed fills should not reduce contrast of embedded text; prefer stroke/glow change over big fill shifts.
- Disabled state should remain legible at ≥3:1 while clearly muted.
