## Keyboard behaviour

- Tab moves into picker; arrow keys (up/down/left/right) move selection within list/grid; Home/End jump to first/last.
- Space/Enter selects focused scheme and triggers `colour_scheme_selected`.
- Maintain focus visible after selection; no focus loss on apply.
- Respect reduced motion: disable animated scheme transitions for keyboard users who prefer reduced motion.
