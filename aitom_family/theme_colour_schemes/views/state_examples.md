## State examples

- Showcase buttons/links under each scheme with states: default, hover, pressed, disabled, focus.
- Include overlay/backdrop sample for modals to show opacity tokens.
- Provide dark baseline and optional inverted/light variant side by side for contrast comparison.
- Keep layout 24-column aware: examples span full width on mobile, split columns on desktop.
- Note that focus rings remain unanimated and high-contrast.
