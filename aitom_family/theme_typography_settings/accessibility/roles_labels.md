## Roles and labels

- If presets shown as selectable list: use `role="radiogroup"` with `radio` options or `listbox` with `option`.
- Each preset gets `aria-label` including role and size (e.g., “Heading 1, 32 pixels”).
- Announce selection changes politely; ensure focus ring visible on dark base.
- Provide text alternative for density toggle if present.
