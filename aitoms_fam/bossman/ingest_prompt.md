Backend integration cheat sheet (frontend-facing)
-------------------------------------------------

- Manifest/token graph: components keyed by `component_id`; content slots `content_slots.<component>.<slot>`; tokens `tokens.<domain>.<component>.<field>` (domains: typography/layout/colour/behaviour). Patches are path-scoped set|delete|merge; no cross-family writes.
- Chat scope: messages may include scope fields surface/app/federation/cluster/gang/agent (legacy kind/target_id still accepted). Scope is logged/tagged and forwarded to LLM calls. Chat transports (HTTP/WS/SSE) include only populated scope keys.
- Tiles API (planning): `GET /tiles?tenant=&env=&surface=&limit=&cursor=&types=` returns ordered tiles (PLAN-0AD schema). Optional WS/SSE. `strategy_lock_state` (pending|allowed|blocked|not_required) + actions only when pre-cleared; revalidate lock before executing. Events: `tiles.composed`, `tile.impression`, `tile.action`. Fields: tile_id, type, size_hint (S/M/L/XL), title/summary/cta_ref, nexus_refs (preferred), external_refs (allowed), pinned, order, timestamps, metadata {tenant_id, env, surface, origin, trace_id}.
- Fonts helper: inputs font_id, preset_code, optional tracking; outputs fontFamily, fontVariationSettings, letterSpacing. Tracking clamped per font bounds; presets define axis values (e.g., Roboto Flex).
- Temperature & Strategy Lock: runtime loads latest approved plan per tenant/env (`temperature_plans_{TENANT_ID}`) or defaults → measure → emit `temperature_measurement` DatasetEvent. Guarded actions: outbound sends, spend/budget, code/infra changes, credentials, destructive data writes, risk increases. Measurements/read-only flows are unguarded.
- Reactive content: watcher consumes publish/ingest DatasetEvents (e.g., `content.published.youtube_video`) and emits `content.reactive.*` follow-ups with refs/trace; no manifest writes.
- Design tools: slides/layers/clips keep content in content_slots; styling/position in tokens. Clusters scoped by capabilities (typography/layout/colour/copy/media); locks/pins may block writes.
- Tool registry: tools have tool_id, kind (external_mcp|internal_engine|http_api|local_helper), schemas, firearms_class, allowed_clusters/gangs, cooldown/rate limits, transport config. Tools do not bypass capabilities.
- Auth/BYOK (planning): tenant/user models and BYOK endpoints expect GSM-held secrets; no raw keys in logs. JWT secret in GSM `auth-jwt-secret`.
- For payload JSON shapes (chat message, tiles response, font helper I/O) or scope/tag formats, ask backend for exact examples.

- UTMs/tracking context: canonical keys `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`, plus house keys `ref`, `click_id`. Read once from URL, store (cookie/localStorage) with expiry (7–30 days), and pass via a `context` bag on all tracking/analytics calls; backend logs UTMs on tracking and tile/chat events. Echoing UTMs in API calls via context (not top-level) is OK.
- Forms: required field `email`; optional `first_name`, `last_name`; allow `metadata`/`utm` object. Hidden fields allowed for UTMs/referrer and anti-spam. Include honeypot + submit timestamp; flag sub-5s submissions. Payload shape: `{form_id, email, first_name, last_name, metadata:{utm:{}, referrer, honeypot}, submitted_at}`. Backend strips/validates PII.
- SEO/meta/schema: defaults from server manifest/cards; FE may override via tokens/props. Expose tokens for `meta_title`, `meta_description`, `canonical_url`, `og:title/description/image`, and a JSON-LD slot (`ld_json`). Supported schema types: `FAQPage`, `Article`, `VideoObject` via `<script type="application/ld+json">` blob. Use signed og:image URL if provided; otherwise standard HTTPS.
- Embeds: allowed domains include YouTube; support privacy mode via youtube-nocookie.com toggle. CSP should allow these; no signed/short links needed for embeds.
- Tracking/consent: atoms accept `tracking_id/view_id` and emit events with `chat_id/tile_id/form_id` plus UTMs when present. Do not include message content or PII. Sinks: GA4 + internal DatasetEvents. Non-essential events gated on consent (GDPR/CCPA); essential operational logs may fire without PII.
- Tokens to expose in builder: UTM propagation toggle, hidden field key/value slots, SEO meta fields, JSON-LD blob slot, tracking context bag, consent gate toggle.
