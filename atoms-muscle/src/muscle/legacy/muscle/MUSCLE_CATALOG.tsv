Muscle Name	Internal Name	Path	Description / Pseudocode	Tech Limits / Notes	Hardening Steps	MCP
Video Slowmo	video_slowmo	engines/muscle/video_slowmo	Generates FFmpeg 'minterpolate' filter string for optical flow slow motion.	Uses MCI (Motion Compensated Interpolation). Fast motion can cause 'warping' artifacts. 'Jerky' results occur if motion estimation fails (fallback to dup frames) or on extreme slowdowns (>400%) without high source framerate.	Add proper service wrapper; Validate target FPS range; Add GPU acceleration support (CUDA/TensorRT) for optical flow.	No
Video Render	video_render	engines/muscle/video_render	Main render engine. Orchestrates Timeline -> FFmpeg Command -> Output Video.	Scopes: render:720p, render:1080p. CPU bound unless hardware encoding configured.	Already follows Golden Standard (MCP + Spec).	Yes
Video Anonymise	video_anonymise	engines/muscle/video_anonymise	Face blurring service. Workflow: List Sequences -> Analyze Regions (Face) -> Add 'face_blur' filter to Timeline.	Default filter strength 1.0. Relies on video_regions accuracy. If regions misses a face, it won't be blurred.	Missing spec.yaml; Add confidence threshold tuning; Add 'blur_type' options (pixelate vs gaussian).	No
Video Text	video_text	engines/muscle/video_text	Renders text strings into transparent images for overlays. Input: Text, Font, Size -> Output: Image Asset.	Preview text in meta truncated to 20 chars. CPU rendering via PIL/TypographyRenderer.	Missing spec.yaml; Add caching for identical text requests; Support vector output (SVG).	No
Video Focus Automation	video_focus_automation	engines/muscle/video_focus_automation	Smart Crop / Reframing. Uses Audio (Speech events) and Visual Meta (Subjects) to generate Pan/Scan keyframes.	Fallback: Center (0.5, 0.5) if no speech/subjects found. 'Jerky' if keyframes are too sparse or interpolation is linear.	Missing spec.yaml; Add smoothing (Spline interpolation) to keyframes to prevent mechanical camera movement.	No
Video Regions	video_regions	engines/muscle/video_regions	Detects regions of interest (Faces, etc.). Wrapper for backends: CPU Face (dlib/cv2), OpenCV, Stub.	Performance depends on backend. CPU backend is slow for 4K video.	Missing spec.yaml; Add GPU/TensorRT backend; Cache results aggressively.	No
Video Visual Meta	video_visual_meta	engines/muscle/video_visual_meta	Analyzes video for structure: Shot Boundaries, Subject Centers, Timestamps. Used by Focus Automation.	Sample interval driven (default often 500ms). Misses fast cuts if interval > shot length.	Missing spec.yaml; Move to frame-accurate detection (scene detect filter).	No
Video 360	video_360	engines/muscle/video_360	Generates FFmpeg expression strings for 360-degree video projection (equirectangular to rectilinear).	Uses 'lerp' for V1 interpolation. Complex math in FFmpeg filter string can be slow.	Missing spec.yaml; Add Quaternion slerp for smoother rotation.	No
Video Stabilise	video_stabilise	engines/muscle/video_stabilise	2-Pass Stabilization. Pass 1: vidstabdetect -> .trf file. Pass 2: vidstabtransform.	Requires 2 full passes over footage. High CPU usage.	Missing spec.yaml; Cache .trf files to avoid re-running Pass 1 on same clip.	No
Video Captions	video_captions	engines/muscle/video_captions	Transcribes audio to caption segments (SRT/JSON style).	Accuracy depends on underlying STT model (not specified in partial scan).	Missing spec.yaml.	No
Video Edit Templates	video_edit_templates	engines/muscle/video_edit_templates	Applies predefined editing patterns (slots) to a set of assets.	Rigid slot structure.	Missing spec.yaml.	No
Video Multicam	video_multicam	engines/muscle/video_multicam	Syncs multiple angles via audio waveform matching. Returns offset (ms) and confidence.	Requires clear audio on all tracks. Fails if audio is silent or radically different.	Missing spec.yaml; Add visual matching (feature matching) fallback.	No
CAD Viewer	cad_viewer	engines/muscle/cad_viewer	Viewer for CAD data. Features: cad:gantt (Gantt Chart View), cad:overlay (Overlays).	Depends on cost_model_id and artifact existence. Returns 404 if artifacts missing.	Maturity: Demo. Needs full tests.	No
CAD Diff	cad_diff	engines/muscle/cad_diff	Computes differences between CAD revisions.	Likely geometry or metadata diff.	Review logic.	No
Image Core	image_core	engines/muscle/image_core	Comprehensive Image Engine. Features: Presets (Social/Web), Composition (Layers, Blend Modes), Subject Detection (OpenCV), Auto Crop (Smart/Center), Generative Fill Hooks.	OpenCV Haar Cascade is 'legacy' compared to DL models (YOLO/Mediapipe). Generative fill is a 'hook' (needs provider).	Missing spec.yaml. Upgrade Subject Detection to Deep Learning model. Implement Generative Fill provider.	No
Audio Service	audio_service	engines/muscle/audio_service	General Audio processing service.	N/A	Check standards.	No
Audio Separation	audio_separation	engines/muscle/audio_separation	Separates stems (Vocals, Drums, Bass, Other) usually via Demucs or Spleeter.	Heavy GPU requirement. Artifacts in 'Other' stem common.	Wrap as MCP.	No
Audio Normalise	audio_normalise	engines/muscle/audio_normalise	Loudness normalization (EBU R128 or Peak).	N/A	Ensure standard LUFS targets.	No
