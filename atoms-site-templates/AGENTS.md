# AGENTS.md — Atoms Site Templates

## Mission
This repo subtree is the **source of truth** for all marketing site templates.

## 🏛️ THE HIERARCHY OF POWER (v2.1)
**Architecture Law**: The relationship between Surfaces and Spaces is **Dynamic Configuration**, not hard-coded logic.

### 1. The Core Hierarchy
*   **Level 1: The Tenant (Wallet)**: The User Identity. Owns Snax.
*   **Level 2: The Space (Context)**: The Data Boundary (Nexus + Feeds). Data **NEVER** leaks between Spaces.
    *   *Shared Assets*: Nexus (Vector Memory), Feeds (RSS/API), Config (Brand Voice).
*   **Level 3: The Surface (Domain)**: The Brand Wrapper & Demographic Interface.
    *   *Dynamic Mapping*: A Surface maps to **ONE** Space at a time via `space_surface_mappings`.
    *   *Contents*: Flows, Canvases, Projects.
*   **Level 4: The Commercial Units**:
    *   *AgentFlow*: Unit of Work (Cost per Run).
    *   *FlowStack*: Unit of Value (Marketplace Asset).
    *   *Firm*: Unit of Scale (Subscription).

### 2. The Data Contract
*   **Feed Contract**: Feeds live in the **Space**. Surfaces read from their mapped Space.
*   **Co-Founder View**: Aggregates Space-level data (Feeds + Nexus) for active BI.
*   **God Mode Injection**: Auto-creates "Self-Feeds" (YouTube) on onboarding.

## Laws
- Templates live here: `/Users/jaynowman/dev/atoms-site-templates/`.
- Live sites are **separate repos** outside `/Users/jaynowman/dev/` (e.g., `/Users/jaynowman/sites/<site>`).
- Deploy via the Press pipeline (clone → repo → Pages → DNS).
- No `.env` files. Use Vault (`/Users/jaynowman/northstar-keys/`) and host env vars.
