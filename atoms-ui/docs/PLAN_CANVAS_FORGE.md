# Atomic Plan: Standardization (Canvas Contract Builder)

**Objective**: Create the "Law" and the "Tool" for standardized canvas generation.

## Phase 1: The Constitution
- [ ] **Create `atoms-ui/agents.md`**:
    -   Define the 4-layer architecture (Harness -> Controller -> Molecule -> Atom).
    -   Define the Tooling Standard (Vario Hooks, ToolPills).

## Phase 2: The Skill
- [ ] **Create `atoms-ui/SKILL_CANVAS_FORGE.md`**:
    -   Use Anthropic Standard (YAML Frontmatter).
    -   Define the `CanvasContract` format.
    -   Write the specific "Prompt Engineering" within the skill file to guide the generation agent.

## Phase 3: Validation (The First Contract Builder)
- [ ] **Build a "Video Canvas"**:
    -   Create a dummy contract `contracts/video-canvas.md`.
    -   Execute the skill (Simulated).
    -   Verify output file structure.
