# Marketplace Trust Strategy: Why the Pivot Demands Blockchain

**The Pivot**: Changing from "Selling our own Code" to "A Marketplace for 3rd Party Developers" (Agent-Gains).

**The Question**: Does this bring forward the need for Blockchain (The Merkle Man)?

**The Answer**: **YES. It shifts "The Merkle Man" from a "Day 100 User Feature" to a "Day 1 Developer Necessity".**

## 1. The Trust Gap has Moved
In the old model (Direct Sales), users just had to trust *you* not to rip them off.
In the new model (Marketplace), there are two layers of distrust:
1.  **The Buyer**: "Did I get what I paid for?"
2.  **The Developer (Seller)**: "Did Agent-Gains count my API calls correctly, or are they hiding 10% of my revenue?"

**Developers will not build on a platform they think is skimming their traffic.**
If you say "You had 1,000 runs" and they see "1,200 requests" on their own server logs, they will leave.

## 2. The Merkle Man as the "Payout Oracle"
Instead of Blockchain being a user gimmick, it becomes the **Legal Source of Truth** for Payouts.

### How it works now:
1.  **Usage**: User A runs Developer B's "Super-SEO-Muscle". cost: 10 Snax.
2.  **Ledger**: `snax_ledger` records `-10` (Buyer) and `+7` (Dev Wallet) and `+3` (Platform Fee).
3.  **The Anchor**: "The Merkle Man" hashes this transaction and posts the root to Solana.

### Why this kills the "Skimming" fear:
*   The Developer can independently verify the Merkle Root on Solana.
*   They receive a cryptographic proof: "Here is the proof that your muscle ran at 10:05 AM."
*   **Result**: You provide **Provable Revenue Share**. This is a massive competitive advantage over closed marketplaces (like OpenAI GPT Store's vague payout logic).

## 3. Revised Roadmap Recommendation
**Move "The Merkle Man" to PHASE 2 (Launch + 1 month), not "Day 100".**

*   **Day 1 (Alpha)**: Internal trust is fine. Friend & Family devs.
*   **Day 30 (Beta/Public)**: You need the "Payout Truth" live.
    *   If you don't have it, you will spend all your support time fighting with devs about "missing stats".
    *   If you DO have it, your marketing pitch is: **" The First Agent Marketplace with On-Chain revenue verification."**

## Summary
The Marketplace pivot makes Blockchain **Functional Infrastructure**, not just "Marketing Fluff". It protects you from liability and attracts high-quality developers who want guaranteed fair pay.
