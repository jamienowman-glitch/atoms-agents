# AGENTS.md — Atoms Site (The Face)

> **The Northstar**: "We are creating Shopify, Klaviyo, Photoshop, CapCut... all run by Agents and Humans on collaborative Canvases."

## 🛑 THE ATOMIC MANDATE
1.  **Never Monolith**: Every concern must be its own "Atom" (Table, Component, Service, Site).
2.  **Collaborative Core**: The "Canvas" is the shared workspace for Humans and Agents.
3.  **Atomic Expansion**: We will not have one central site. We will have many microsites targeting individual markets.
4.  **Registry First**: "If we hit something new, we add it to the Registry."

## 🏗️ CONTEXT
This repository holds the Marketing Microsites.
-   **Style**: Pure Black, White Text, Graph Paper accents.
-   **Tech**: Next.js, Tailwind, Framer Motion.
