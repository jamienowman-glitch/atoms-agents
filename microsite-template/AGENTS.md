# AGENTS.md — Atoms Site (The Face)

## Active Initiatives: MAYBES & HAZE
- **MAYBES**: Note-taking city canvas where ToolPill/ToolPop create nodes (text/audio/image). Nodes can be forwarded to Harness flows. Data stored in Supabase registry; media stored in S3 with URI refs; tenant-compute first.
- **HAZE**: Nexus Explorer planetary canvas (first-person on curved surface). Client device CPU/GPU for interactive render; server render only for export/offline. Uses HAZE muscles (surface renderer, runner, preview, optional contours) and registers via Supabase.


> **The Northstar**: "We are creating Shopify, Klaviyo, Photoshop, CapCut... all run by Agents and Humans on collaborative Canvases."

## 🗺️ Strategic Infrastructure (V2 VISION)
> **The Hierarchy**: Tenant (Org) -> Space (Context) -> Surface (Flow).
> **The 4 Spaces**: `Health`, `Marketing`, `Quantum`, `Tuning`.

*   **Space**: The Shared Nexus (Memory & Config). Multiple Surfaces share ONE Space.
*   **Surface**: The Flow Container (Not an App). It runs on a Domain (URL).
*   **Tenant**: The Billing Unit.

## 🎨 UI FOUNDRY (V2 STANDARD)
> **The Law**: All new Canvases must use the **V2 Contract** and **Vario Harness**.
> **The 3 Surfaces**:
> 1.  **ChatRail (Left)**: Communication & Stream.
> 2.  **TopPill (Top-Right)**: Global View/Export.
> 3.  **ToolPop (Bottom)**: Contextual "Dynamic Island" with Dual Magnifiers & Sliders.

## 🛑 THE ATOMIC MANDATE
1.  **Never Monolith**: Every concern must be its own "Atom" (Table, Component, Service, Site).
2.  **Collaborative Core**: The "Canvas" is the shared workspace for Humans and Agents.
3.  **Atomic Expansion**: We will not have one central site. We will have many microsites targeting individual markets.
4.  **Registry First**: "If we hit something new, we add it to the Registry."

## 🏗️ CONTEXT
This repository holds the Marketing Microsites.
-   **Style**: Pure Black, White Text, Graph Paper accents.
-   **Tech**: Next.js, Tailwind, Framer Motion.
## Tenant/Surface/Space Law
- Tenant is the billing unit. Snax wallets are tenant-scoped and spendable across all surfaces/spaces.
- Surface is the configuration layer for tenants. Data isolation is per-surface unless explicitly shared.
- Space is shared context across one or more surfaces; only surfaces explicitly mapped to a space share performance/nexus data.
- Do not hardcode surface names in schemas or code; treat surfaces/spaces as registry/config data.
