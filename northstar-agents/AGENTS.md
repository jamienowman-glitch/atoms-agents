# AGENTS.md — Atoms Agents (The Brain)

> **The Northstar**: "We are creating Shopify, Klaviyo, Photoshop, CapCut... all run by Agents and Humans on collaborative Canvases."

## 🛑 THE ATOMIC MANDATE
1.  **Never Monolith**: Every concern must be its own "Atom" (Table, Component, Service, Site).
2.  **Registry First**: Agent definitions (Personas) live in the Registry.
3.  **Atomic Intelligence**: Agents are assembled from Cards (Persona + Model + Style), not hardcoded.

## 🏗️ CONTEXT
This repository holds the **Intelligence Logic**:
-   **Routing Cards**: Which model to use for what task.
-   **Prompt Templates**: The raw instructions.
