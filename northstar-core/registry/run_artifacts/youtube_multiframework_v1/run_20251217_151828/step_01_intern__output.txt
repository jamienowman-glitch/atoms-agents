### **Summary of the Trends Report 2025:**
The report highlights five emerging trends in technology, lifestyle, and education:
1. **"Slow Tech"** – A backlash against digital overload, with people adopting simple devices (like "dumb phones") and analog hobbies.
2. **AI Agents** – AI becoming more autonomous, handling daily tasks like scheduling and shopping without constant user input.
3. **Urban Farming** – Hydroponics and small-scale indoor farming are gaining popularity as food costs rise.
4. **Retro Gaming Revival** – Nostalgia-driven interest in vintage consoles (N64, PS1) and collecting hardware.
5. **Kid-Friendly Coding** – Python-based programming is being simplified and gamified for younger children.
