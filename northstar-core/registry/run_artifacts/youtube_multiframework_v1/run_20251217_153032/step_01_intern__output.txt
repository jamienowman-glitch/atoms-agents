### **Summary of the Report (Late 2025 AI & Agent Landscape)**

This report provides a deep dive into the **state of AI agents, orchestration, and AI-built software** as of late 2025, highlighting major advancements across **frameworks, runtime platforms, AI-native tooling, orchestration, models, and generative interface innovations**.

#### **Key Themes & Shifts from 2024:**
1. **Evolution of the "Center of Gravity"**
   - Shift from raw generative AI models to **embedded frameworks, tools, and orchestration**.
   - **Genuine progress (e.g., structured agent workflows, multi-model routing)** vs. **rebranded or Casey-style hype (e.g., "AI agents" without real value)**.

2. **Layers of the Agent Stack**
   ***(⟶ Runtime Layer)**
   - **Open-source frameworks:**
     LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen (AG2), MetaGPT, SmolAgents, LlamaIndex Agents, Strands, Pydantic AI, Semantic Kernel.
   - **Vendor-native stacks:**
     - OpenAI (AgentKit + Workflows)
     - Google (Vertex ADK + Agent Builder)
     - AWS (Bedrock Agents + AgentCore)
     - Microsoft (Agent Framework using Semantic Kernel + AutoGen)
   - **Workflow Orchestration (Temporal, Prefect, Dagster)** – Now used to implement **durable, long-running agent flows** (e.g., multi-step problem-solving).
   - **Emerging research models:**
     - **CAMEL** (multi-agent collaboration frameworks)
     - **Graph-of-Thoughts** (structured reasoning)
     - **Market-based AI agents** (task allocation via algorithms like procurement rules).
     - **"Debate loops"** for dynamic self-improvement.

   ***(⟶ Build-Time Layer: AI-Native IDEs & Code Runtimes)**
   - Email-like AI tools (Google **Antigravity** – AI co-pilot for VS Code)
   - **AWS Kiro** (AI-driven **automatic fixer for bugs and TOML configs**)
   - **Multi-file & repository agents** (contextual reasoning & codegen)
   - **Atomic edits & safe execution** (aligned with ATOMS principles, e.g., version control, testing).

3. **Multi-Orchestrator Patterns & Standardization**
   - Applications **largely assume "home field" orchestration** (e.g., Firestore for collaboration).
   - **Heterogeneous orchestration** desired (e.g., combing **AutoGen with Temporal**), but lacks an **A2A (agent-to-agent) protocol**.
   - **Roots Manuva’s agent router** attempts integration but faces gaps in policy sync, debugging, and parallel execution.

4. **Improved Agent Models**
   - **Tool-use & planning-optimized LLMs**
     - OpenAI **AgentKit** with dynamic tool-switching
     - Claude **"Thinking" modes** (dedicated reasoning layers)
   - **Orchestration-specific fine-tunes** (mostly research; no clear public release yet).
   - **Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLAIF/RLHF)** for **agent policy tuning** (e.g., cost/efficiency balance).

5. **Generative UI & 3D/Video/AI Agents**
   - **UI-level integration:**
     - **Galileo AI** (Figma to React auto-generated) and other **design-to-code agents**.
   - **Real-time generative UIs** (web apps infused with AI in interaction feedback).
   - **WebGPU/WASM** = enabling **compute-heavy AI tasks in browsers** (e.g., AI-generated 3D art & videos in client-side).
   - **3D, video, and image AI engines** (rem-նote: likely **AI-generated interactive media via LLMs + advanced graphics**).
