### **Round 2: Critique of Other Ideas**

**“Hydroponics on a Budget: Can YOU Grow Food in Your Apartment?”**  
While this idea has strong SEO potential and aligns with wellness trends, it risks feeling **niche and technical** for broader audiences. The barrier to entry — both in terms of interest and resources — may limit virality. It’s excellent for a dedicated gardening or sustainability channel but less likely to drive explosive growth or cross-platform sharing.

**“AI is Taking Over Your To-Do List – Here’s How to Outsmart It”**  
This topic is timely and relevant, but the subject matter can feel **intimidating or abstract** to casual viewers. Many may tune out if they perceive AI as too complex or if the tone leans too heavily into fear-mongering. It’s strong for tech-savvy professionals but may struggle to maintain broad, lasting engagement.

**“The Strange Rise of ‘Dumb Phones’ – Is Detoxing Your Life the Next Trend?”**  
While culturally cool and meme-worthy, this idea risks **preaching to the choir**. The audience that already embraces digital detox may love it, but it lacks the **universal hook** needed for mass appeal. It’s more of a lifestyle statement than a practical guide — great for branding, but less effective for driving subscriber growth.

**“N64 Thrift Store Revelation: What’s Hidden in Consoles Worth $10?”**  
Nostalgia is powerful, but this topic is **highly niche** — limited to retro gamers and collectors. While it has strong SEO and shareability *within that community*, it lacks the **broad demographic reach** needed for wide-scale virality or subscriber expansion. It’s perfect for a dedicated retro gaming channel but not for general audience growth.
