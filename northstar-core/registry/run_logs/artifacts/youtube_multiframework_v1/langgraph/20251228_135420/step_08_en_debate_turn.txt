My favorite idea for brand alignment is: **"Debunking 5 Common Productivity Myths That Are Actually Making You *Less* Productive."**

This title perfectly aligns with a premium image. It promises genuine, sophisticated insight and positions the brand as an authoritative source challenging conventional wisdom. It offers substantive value, focusing on deep understanding rather than superficial intrigue or sensationalism. This approach builds trust and respects the audience, steering clear of clickbait while still being highly engaging and informative.
