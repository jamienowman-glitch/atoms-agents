Here are the SEO critiques for the other ideas:

**"Debunking 5 Common Productivity Myths That Are Actually Making You *Less* Productive."**
While "productivity myths" is a decent keyword, the overall title structure is less direct for high-volume, solution-oriented queries. Users seeking "productivity tips" or "how to be more productive" might bypass this contrarian approach. The "debunking" angle can be niche, potentially limiting its appeal to a broader search audience actively looking for direct improvement strategies rather than myth challenges.

**"Why Your 'Perfect' Morning Routine Is Actually Ruining Your Life."**
This title is strong for virality but weak for evergreen SEO. Primary searches for "morning routine" often seek how-to guides or inspiration, not contrarian debunking. The provocative nature, while click-worthy, doesn't clearly signal informational value aligned with typical search intent. It risks attracting clicks based on shock value rather than genuine keyword relevance, impacting long-term organic traffic.

**"Watch My Brand New Channel Go From 0 to 1000 Subs in 30 Days (A Real-Time Experiment)."**
The title is overly personal ("My Brand New Channel") and time-sensitive ("in 30 Days"), hindering evergreen SEO potential. Searchers typically look for universal, ongoing advice on "how to grow a YouTube channel" or "get 1000 subscribers," not a specific, past experiment. The personal narrative dilutes direct keyword focus, making it less likely to rank for high-volume, general advice queries.

**"I Tried To Live Like A 'Digital Nomad' For A Week (And Failed Hilariously)."**
This title relies heavily on a personal narrative and a "failure" angle, which isn't optimized for common SEO queries related to "digital nomad." People search for guides, tips, or experiences, not usually personal accounts of failure, especially with "hilariously." While engaging, it lacks clear, high-intent keywords that signal value to a broad audience actively researching the digital nomad lifestyle.
