The 'Top 10 AI Tools for Small Businesses' idea, while practical, is unlikely to achieve significant viral views or rapid subscriber growth. It's a saturated, generic format that lacks emotional triggers like humor or shock needed for widespread social sharing. People seek utility, but rarely *share* basic listicles, limiting organic discovery beyond direct search. This passive approach means it won't stand out in crowded feeds or spark conversations, resulting in slow, incremental views rather than the exponential growth a growth hacker targets for new subscribers.
