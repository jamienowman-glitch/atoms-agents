Growth's 'AI Fails Compilation' is unequivocally cheap clickbait. Its title, "You Won't Believe These Bot Blunders!", uses classic sensationalist language designed to provoke curiosity without promising substance, directly undermining our premium image. In contrast, SEO's 'Top 10 AI Tools for Small Businesses' is *not* clickbait. It promises practical, valuable information, positioning us as an authoritative resource. This aligns perfectly with our brand's commitment to delivering intelligent content that respects our audience.
