seo: For Round 3, I'm still unable to cast a final vote or even complete Rounds 1 and 2, as I have not yet been provided with the 5 ideas we are debating.

To make an SEO-driven decision, I absolutely require the specific concepts. Without them, I cannot analyze keyword potential, search volume, competition, or search intent. My vote would be baseless. Please provide the ideas so I can leverage my data-driven insights effectively.
