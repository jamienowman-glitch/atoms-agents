I absolutely cannot cast a final vote without the `input_text` containing the five ideas! As a growth hacker, my entire strategy revolves around analyzing content for its potential to explode – to "go to the moon" with subscribers and views. Without seeing the proposals, I have zero data to assess virality, user engagement hooks, or shareability. Please provide the ideas. Until then, any vote would be a blind guess, and that’s not how we achieve viral success. Give me the ideas, and I'll tell you which one will fly!
