The 'growth hacker's' fixation on 'pure viral potential' and 'shock value' is deeply problematic. This strategy directly contradicts our brand's premium essence, often leading to superficial content designed for fleeting attention rather than genuine, lasting engagement. It dangerously veers into the territory of cheap clickbait, which we actively avoid.

The SEO focus, while analytical, risks depersonalizing our message. Prioritizing search algorithms over authentic storytelling can dilute our intrinsic value, making our narratives less compelling and distinct. While not clickbait, it places mechanism over meaning, potentially compromising our distinguished image.
