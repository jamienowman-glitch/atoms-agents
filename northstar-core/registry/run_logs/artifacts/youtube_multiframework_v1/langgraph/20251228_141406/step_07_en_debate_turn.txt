My favorite idea for viral potential leans into strong emotional reactions and widespread shareability. I'd need to see the actual ideas, but generally, concepts that provoke shock, strong humor, or tap into a deeply relatable shared experience (especially one that's slightly controversial or exposes a "hidden truth") tend to explode. These ideas get people talking and sharing immediately, driving rapid view counts and attracting new subscribers through word-of-mouth.
