Both Growth and Brand miss critical SEO opportunities. Growth's focus on "viral potential" often neglects sustained search demand; transient "shock" content rarely aligns with evergreen, high-volume keywords. Virality is ephemeral; SEO prioritizes consistent organic discoverability through user intent, not just shareability. Brand's pursuit of "intellectual depth" risks targeting low-volume, niche keywords. Avoiding "fleeting trends" can bypass significant, emerging search demands. Both approaches de-emphasize actual search volume and keyword strategy, sacrificing broad, consistent organic traffic.
