SEO's keyword-driven strategy, while steady, often lacks the emotional resonance or immediate shareability crucial for viral explosions. It prioritizes discoverability over the inherent 'wow' factor that drives rapid views and subscriber surges. Brand's pursuit of "intellectual depth" and aversion to "sensationalism" can be too niche, sacrificing mass appeal. By shunning engaging trends and strong reactions, they miss critical opportunities for content to spread organically and exponentially, leading to slower growth and fewer breakthrough subscriber gains compared to virally optimized content.
