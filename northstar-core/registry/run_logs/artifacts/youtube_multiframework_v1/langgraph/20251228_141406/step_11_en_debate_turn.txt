Growth's pursuit of "shock" and "strong emotional reactions" is a clear path to cheap clickbait, prioritizing fleeting virality over substantive engagement. This approach fundamentally undermines authenticity, reducing content to sensationalism for rapid, but ultimately superficial, attention. SEO, while valuing discoverability, risks advocating for content driven purely by algorithmic trends rather than genuine value. Its focus on broad search volume can inadvertently dilute our premium message, pushing for topics that lack the intellectual depth and refined quality our discerning audience expects, ultimately compromising our brand's integrity for traffic.
