    \ Nu Town Clan back in '93, needs a *solid* foundation. Speaking of solid, remember\
    \ Tony \"Two-Toes\" Tortellini from down the block? Nah, just kidding. He was\
    \ a legend, but not a member. Anyway, where was I? Right, Coding in the Cloud.\
    \ Let's give this chorus some *real* New York flavor, something that'd make even\
    \ Marco \"The Maestro\" Mancini proud (he was our official Clan poet for, like,\
    \ an hour. Rhymed \"pizza\" with \"seizure.\" It wasn't pretty). \n\nOkay, here's\
    \ my take, draft_v2:\n\n**Draft_v2:**\n\nYo, cloud coding's the bomb, straight\
    \ outta Queensbridge tech,\nNo more lugging floppy disks, a hustle that's complex,\n\
    Nu Town Clan approves, future's built on these bytes, respect!\n"

    **final_chorus:**


    Coding in the cloud, accessible to all.

    No local installs, answering freedom''s call.

    The future''s here, cloud code stands up tall.


    **constraints_checklist:**


    *   **Length:** Adheres to the 3-line requirement.

    *   **Clarity:** Clear and concise language.

    *   **Safety:** Devoid of potentially offensive or inappropriate content.

    *   **Preservation of Agent Contributions:** Retains the core theme of cloud coding
    and a sense of forward momentum. Removes overly stylized language.
