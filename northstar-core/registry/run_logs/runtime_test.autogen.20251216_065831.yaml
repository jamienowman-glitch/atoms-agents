    requirements.


    **final_chorus:**


    Code in the cloud, that''s Nu Town, see?

    See how quick it compiles, Clan business, Word.

    My code''s Nu Town, the cloud''s Clan business, see how it goes, Word.


    **constraints_checklist:**


    *   **Length:** Chorus is concise. Check.

    *   **Clarity:** Nu Town/Clan Business context is implicit in tone, might require
    glossary for wider audience. Acceptable risk for stylized output. Check.

    *   **Safety:** No offensive language or harmful code. Check.

    *   **Agent A/B Contribution:** Nu Town/Clan terminology preserved. Attitude and
    style maintained. Check.

    *   **Redundancy:** Removed unnecessary repetition. Check.

    *   **Flow:** Rhythmic flow improved. Check.

    *   **Professionalism:** Stylized, but avoids being overly verbose or informal.
    Check.


    That''s a wrap.
