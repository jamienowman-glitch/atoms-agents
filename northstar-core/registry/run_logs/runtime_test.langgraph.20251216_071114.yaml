    \ just pure *Nu Town Clan*,\n\nWe didn\u2019t need no server rack, just a Wi-Fi\
    \ *ping*,  \nAnd a notebook, a dream, and a little *ding-ding*,  \nBack when the\
    \ clan was tight, and the code was *singing*,\n\nFrom \u201CHello World\u201D\
    \ to \u201CBye, felonious\u201D,  \nWe built it all in the cloud, no need for\

    \n---\n\n**Footnotes (for the culture):**  \n- *Peng*: Our clan\u2019s official\
    \ adjective for anything flawless, from a fresh sneaker to a perfectly optimized\
    \ algorithm.  \n- *Weng-weng*: The sound of a text message blowing up your phone\
    \ \u2014 or a program compiling successfully.  \n- *Clank*: When you shut your\
    \ laptop with the satisfaction of a job well done\u2026 or a successful heist\
    \ in San Andreas.  \n- *Chronos*: The imaginary clock we never trusted. Time was\
    \ for squares. We had *code*.  \n\n**Disclaimer:** The Nu Town Clan never actually\
    \ *hacked* anything. We mostly tried to download games off Napster and failed.\
    \ But in our minds? We were legends. And that\u2019s what matters."
