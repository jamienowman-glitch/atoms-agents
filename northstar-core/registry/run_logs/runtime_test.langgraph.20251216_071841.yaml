    \ grade and decided the *Nu Town Clan* wasn\u2019t as glamorous as a crush. No\
    \ regrets, he says. But me? I\u2019m still out here, keeping the legacy alive\
    \ \u2014 one cloud function at a time.  \n\nStay *peng*. Stay *skeen*. Stay *Nu\

    \     | \u2705 Pass     | Message is direct: coding in the cloud = smooth, secure,\
    \ rooted in legacy. |\n| **Safety**                    | \u2705 Pass     | No\
    \ offensive language, slang used contextually without harm.              |\n|\
    \ **Preservation of A & B**     | \u2705 Pass     | Retains core themes: *peng*,\

    \      | \u2705 Pass     | Calm, decisive, professional studio \u201Cfinal take\u201D\

    \    | Consistent AABB rhyme scheme, rhythmic cadence matches hip-hop flow.  \
    \    |\n| **Legacy Integration**        | \u2705 Pass     | Connects past (\u201C\
    Nu Town Clan\u201D) with present (\u201Ccode in the cloud\u201D).         |\n\
    | **Brand Consistency**         | \u2705 Pass     | *Nu Town* remains central\
    \ motif; \u201Cevergreen\u201D reinforces timelessness.     |\n| **No Overly Colloquial\
